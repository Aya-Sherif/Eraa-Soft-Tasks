1-WHERE vs. HAVING:

WHERE: Used in a SELECT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement to filter records based on a specified condition. It is applied before the data is grouped and aggregated.
HAVING: Used in a SELECT statement to filter the results of aggregate functions applied to grouped data. It is applied after the data is grouped and aggregated.


2-DELETE vs. TRUNCATE:

DELETE: Removes rows from a table based on a condition. It is a Data Manipulation Language (DML) command and can be rolled back.
TRUNCATE: Removes all rows from a table, but it is a Data Definition Language (DDL) command. It is faster than DELETE as it doesn't log individual row deletions, and it cannot be rolled back.


3-When 
It selects different results based on specified conditions for each row.

SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN condition1 THEN result1
        WHEN condition2 THEN result2
        ELSE result3
    END AS new_column
FROM your_table;


4-Union
 The UNION operator is used to combine the results of two SELECT statements.
 It effectively merges the result sets, eliminating duplicate rows.
The number and data types of columns in the SELECT statements must match for a successful UNION.

Example: Combining unique rows from two tables into a single result set.
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table2;

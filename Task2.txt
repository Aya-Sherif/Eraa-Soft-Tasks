Q1 echo vs print ?
The difference between echo and print is that print has a return value, which is one, and can take only one argument. It is slower than echo. On the other hand, echo doesn't have a return value and can take more than one parameter, making it faster than print..

Q2 What is JIT Compile ?
JIT, short for 'Just-In-Time' Compile, translates the code of high-level programming languages (interpreted languages) into machine code at runtime, just before execution. It operates dynamically during program execution. JIT is one of the major features in PHP 8 designed to improve the performance of PHP scripts

Q3 Compile time vs run time
Compile time is the period during which the code is translated into machine code or intermediate code, while runtime is the time when the code is executed on the computer. There are two types of errors: those detected by the compiler during compile time and runtime errors, which can only be identified during execution.

Q4 Loosely type vs strongly type programming language

In loosely-typed languages, variable types are not strictly enforced, allowing them to change during runtime without declaration. In strongly-typed languages, variable types are strictly enforced, requiring declaration with a specific type, and they cannot be changed during runtime.

Q5  TCP vs UDP
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two distinct communication protocols used in networking. TCP is connection-oriented, establishing a connection between sender and receiver before data transfer, ensuring reliable and ordered delivery of data with mechanisms like acknowledgment and retransmission. In contrast, UDP is connectionless, sending packets individually without prior connection, offering lower latency but without guaranteed delivery or ordered arrival. TCP's reliability, ordered delivery, and flow control make it suitable for applications like web browsing and file transfer, while UDP's speed and connectionless nature make it ideal for real-time applications such as online gaming, streaming, and voice over IP (VoIP). The choice between TCP and UDP depends on the specific needs of the application, balancing reliability against low-latency requirements.
